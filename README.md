![enlarge_RTL](https://github.com/Khalid072/RV32I-Single-Cycle/assets/149706572/de8e6bbd-bd47-40db-ab94-17106ba9c907)


This GitHub repository houses a comprehensive SystemVerilog implementation of a RV32I Single Cycle Core using the Xilinx Vivado toolchain. The RV32I architecture, based on the RISC-V instruction set, is a 32-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture that serves as a robust foundation for beginners and a variety of embedded applications.

Key Features:

RV32I Single Cycle Core: The repository contains a complete implementation of the RV32I core, which executes instructions in a single clock cycle. This design choice ensures simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for applications with real-time requirements.

SystemVerilog Implementation: The core is coded using SystemVerilog, a hardware description and verification language that combines features of Verilog with advanced programming constructs. This choice enables a clean and concise representation of the RV32I core design.

Vivado Integration: The design is tailored to seamlessly integrate with Xilinx Vivado, a powerful FPGA development environment. This integration facilitates synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation for Xilinx FPGAs, allowing users to deploy the RV32I core on Xilinx hardware platforms.
